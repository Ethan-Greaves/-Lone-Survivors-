## Overview ðŸ“–
**"The war has ended, the bombs have exploded! Now, it's just you and one turret left. Can you survive against the hordes of mutated enemies?"**

Lone Survivors is a game created in Unity for an assignment in my second year of university. It uses many features of the Unity engine and is written in C#, 
a web page was also created for the game, as well as a game design document, and a marketing plan.
